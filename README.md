# Ants Vs. SomeBees

### 1. Introduction
In this project, we will create a __tower defense__ game called __Ants Vs. SomeBees__. As the ant queen, we populate our colony with the bravest ants we can muster. Our ants must protect our queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and our queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' [Plants Vs. Zombies].

### 2. Core Concepts
A game of Ants Vs. SomeBees consists of a series of turns. In each turn, new bees may enter the ant colony. Then, new ants are placed. Finally, all insects (ants, then bees) take individual actions: bees sting ants, and ants throw leaves at bees. The game ends either when a bee reaches the ant queen (we lose), or the entire bee flotilla has been vanquished (we win).

- __The Colony:__ The colony consists of several places that are chained together. The `exit` of each `Place` leads to another `Place`.
- __Placing Ants:__ There are two constraints that limit ant production. Placing an ant uses up some amount of the colony's food, a different amount for each type of ant. Also, only one ant can occupy each `Place`.
- __Bees:__ When it is time to act, a bee either moves to the `exit` of its current `Place` if no ant blocks its path, or stings an ant that blocks its path.
- __Ants:__ Each type of ant takes a different action and requires a different amount of food to place. The two most basic ant types are the `HarvesterAnt`, which adds one food to the colony during each turn, and the `ThrowerAnt`, which throws a leaf at a bee each turn.

Attacks should damage the `BodyguardAnt` first and only hurt the protected ant after the `BodyguardAnt` has run out of armour. Meanwhile the ant inside of a bodyguard should still be able to perform its original action.           |

### 5. Running the game

There are 3 ways to run the game:

1. text-based
    ```sh
    $ python3 ants.py
    ```

2. Python GUI
    ```sh
    $ python3 ants_gui.py
    ```

3. Web-based GUI (recommended)
    ```sh
    $ python3 gui.py
    ```

All the methods above follow the same arguments:

    usage: gui.py [-h] [-d DIFFICULTY] [-w] [--food FOOD]
    
    Play Ants vs. SomeBees
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -d DIFFICULTY  sets difficulty of game (easy/medium/hard/insane)
      -w, --water    loads a full layout with water
      --food FOOD    number of food to start with when testing

e.g. 
```sh
$ python3 gui.py -d hard -w
```
